# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor

## Description:

Horiseon is an SEO marketing company that needs their website to be accessible and search engine optimized.  In order to accomplish that, I made the following changes:

* Added semantic elements to the html code,
* Swapped out legacy code in the stylesheet for sementic tags that matched the html code (main, nav, aside, footer),
* Added alt tags for all the images,
* Cleaned up the code,
* And added comments to nake it easy for another coder to make edits after me.
